pasturage, hay, or ensilage. With the possible exception
of alfalfa on fertile soil, sweet clover, when properly
handled, will furnish as much nutritious pasturage
from early spring until late fall as any other legume. It seldom
causes bloat.</p>

<p>Stock may refuse to eat sweet clover at first, but this distaste
can be overcome by keeping them on a field of young
plants for a few days.</p>

<p>As cattle crave dry roughage when pasturing on sweet
clover, they should have access to it. Straw answers this
purpose very well.</p>

<p>An acre of sweet clover ordinarily will support 20 to 30
sholes.</p>

<p>On account of the succulent growth, it is often difficult,
in humid climates, to cure the first crop of the second season
into a good quality of hay.</p>

<p>When seeded without a nurse crop, one cutting of hay
may be obtained the first year in the North and two or
three cullings in the South. Two cuttings are often obtained
in the South after grain harvest. The second year
a cutting of hay and a seed crop usually are harvested.</p>

<p>Sweet clover should never be permitted to show flower
buds before it is cut for hay. It is very important that
the first crop of the second season be cut so high that a new
growth will develop. When the plants have made a growth
of 36 to 40 inches it may be necessary to leave the stubble
10 to 12 inches high.</p>

<p>In cutting the first crop of the second season it is a good
plan to have extension shoe soles made for the mower, so
that a high stubble may be left. In some sections of the
country sweet clover as a silage plant is gaining in favor
rapidly.</p>

<p>This crop has given excellent results as a feed for cattle
and sheep. Experiments show that it compares favorably
with alfalfa.</p>

<p>Sweet clover has proved to be a profitable soil-improving
crop. The large, deep roots add much humus to the soil
and improve the aeration and drainage. As a rule, the yield
of crops following sweet clover is increased materially.</p>

<p>Being a biennial, this crop lends itself readily to short
rotations.</p>

<p>Sweet clover is a valuable honey plant, in that in all sections
of the country it secretes an abundance of nectar.</p>

<p>This bulletin discusses only, the utilization of sweet clover.

</div>


<p>The utilization of sweet clover as a feed for all classes of live stock
has increased rapidly in many parts of the country, owing primarily
to the excellent results obtained by many farmers who have used
this plant for pasturage or hay, and also to the fact that feeding and
digestion experiments conducted by agricultural experiment stations
show that it is practically equal to alfalfa and red clover as
a feed.</p>

<p>As a pasture plant, sweet clover is superior to red clover, and possibly
alfalfa, as it seldom causes bloat, will grow on poor soils, and is
drought resistant. The favorable results obtained from the utilization
of this crop for pasturage have done much to promote its culture
in many parts of the United States. On account of the succulent,
somewhat stemmy growth of the first crop the second year, difficulty
is often experienced in curing the hay in humid sections, as it
is necessary to cut it at a time when weather conditions are likely to
be unfavorable. When properly cured the hay is relished by stock.</p>

<p>At the present time sweet clover is used to only a limited extent
for silage, but its use for this purpose should increase rapidly, as the
results thus far obtained have been very satisfactory.</p>

<p>In addition to the value of sweet clover as a feed, it is one of the
best soil-improving crops adapted to short rotations which can be
grown. When cut for hay, the stubble and roots remain in the soil,
and when pastured, the uneaten parts of the plants, as well as the
manure made while animals are on pasture, are added to the soil and
benefit the succeeding crops. In addition to humus, sweet clover, in
common with all legumes, adds nitrogen to the soil. This crop is
grown in many sections of the country primarily to improve soils, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>« 4 »</span>
the benefits derived from it when handled in this manner have justified
its use, as the yields of succeeding crops usually are increased
materially.</p>

<p>The different species of sweet clover are excellent honey plants, as
they produce nectar over a long period in all sections of the United
States.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of alfalfa on fertile soils, no other
leguminous crop will furnish as much nutritious pasturage from
early spring until late fall as sweet clover when it is properly
handled. Live stock which have never been fed sweet clover may
refuse to eat it at first, but this distaste is easily overcome by turning
them on the pasture in the spring, as soon as the plants start
growth (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Many cases are on record where stock have preferred
sweet clover to other forage plants. The fact that it may
be pastured earlier in the spring than many forage plants and that
it thrives throughout the hot summer months makes it a valuable
addition to the pastures on many farms. Sweet clover is an especially
valuable forage plant for poor soils where other crops make
but little growth, and it is upon such soils that thousands of acres of
this crop are furnishing annually abundant pasturage for all kinds
of live stock. In many portions of the Middle West, where the conditions
are similar to those of southeastern Kansas, it bids fair to
solve the serious pasturage problems. Native pastures which will
no longer provide more than a scant living for a mature steer on 4 or
5 acres, when properly seeded to sweet clover will produce sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>« 5 »</span>
forage to carry at least one animal to the acre throughout the season.
In addition to this, a crop of hay or a seed crop may be harvested
from a portion of the land when it is so fenced that the stock may be
confined to certain parts of the field at specific times. Land which is
too rough or too depleted for cultivation, or permanent pastures
which have become thin and weedy, may be improved greatly by
drilling in, after disking, a few pounds of sweet-clover seed per acre.
Not only will the sweet clover add considerably to the quality and
quantity of the pasturage but the growth of the grasses will be improved
by the addition of large quantities of humus and nitrogen
to the soil.</p>

<p>Sweet clover has proved to be an excellent pasture crop on many
of the best farms in the North-Central States. In this part of the
country it may be seeded alone and pastured from the middle or latter
part of June until frost, or it may be sown with grain and pastured
after harvest.</p>

<p>When sweet clover has been seeded two years in succession on
separate fields, the field sown the first year may be pastured until the
middle of June, when the stock should be turned on the spring
seeding. When handled in this manner excellent pasturage is provided
throughout the summer, and a hay or seed crop may be harvested
from the field seeded the previous season.</p>

<p>Some of the best pastures in Iowa consist of a mixture of Kentucky
bluegrass, timothy, and sweet clover. On a farm observed near
Delmar, Iowa, stock is pastured on meadows containing this mixture
from the first part of April to the middle of June. From this
time until the first part of September the stock is kept on one-half
to two-thirds the total pasture acreage. The remainder of the pasture
land is permitted to mature a seed crop. After the seed crop is harvested
the stock again is turned on this acreage, where they feed on
the grasses and first-year sweet-clover plants until cold weather. The
seed which shatters when the crop is cut is usually sufficient to reseed
the pastures. By handling his pasture land in this manner, the
owner of the farm has always had an abundance of pasture and at
the same time has obtained each year a crop of 2 to 4 bushels of recleaned
seed to the acre from one-third to one-half of his pasture
land. This system has been in operation on one field for 20 years and
not until the last two year's has bluegrass showed a tendency to
crowd out the sweet clover. It is essential that sufficient stock be
kept on the pastures to keep the plants eaten rather closely, so that
at all times there will be an abundance of fresh shoots.</p>

<p>Whenever the first crop of the second year is not needed for hay
or silage it can be used for no better purpose than pasturage. In
fact, it is better to pasture the fields until the middle of June, as this
affords one of the most economical and profitable ways of handling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>« 6 »</span>
the first crop. In addition to its value for pasture, grazing induces
the plants to send out many young shoots close to the ground, so
that when the plants are permitted to mature seed a much larger
number of stalks are formed than would be the case if the first crop
were cut for hay. The hay crop is likely to be cut so close to the
ground that the plants will be killed, whereas but little danger of
killing the plants arises from close pasturing early in the season.
Excellent stands of sweet clover will produce an abundance of pasturage
for two to three mature steers per acre from early spring
to the middle of June.</p>

<p>Cattle which are pasturing on sweet clover alone crave dry feed.
Straw has been found to satisfy this desire and straw or hay should
be present in the meadow at all times, After stock are removed
from the field it is an excellent plan to go over it with a mower,
setting the cutter bar so as to leave the stubble 6 to 8 inches high.
This will even up the stand, so that the plants will ripen seed at
approximately the same date.</p>

<p>Experiments by many farmers in the Middle West show that sweet
clover is an excellent pasture for dairy cattle. When cows are turned
on sweet clover from grass pastures the flow of milk is increased and
its quality improved. Other conditions being normal, this increase in
milk production will continue throughout the summer, as the plants
produce an abundance of green forage during the hot, dry months
when grass pastures are unproductive. If pastures are handled properly
they will carry at least one milk cow to the acre during the
summer months.</p>

<p>In many parts of the country sweet clover has proved to be an
excellent pasturage crop for hogs. When it is utilized for this purpose
it usually is seeded alone and pastured for two seasons. The
hogs may be turned on the field the first year as soon as the plants
have made a 6-inch growth. From this time until late fall an
abundance of forage is produced, as pasturing induces the plants to
send out many tender, succulent branches. Pasturing the second
season may begin as soon as growth starts in the spring. If the
field is not closely grazed the second season it is advisable to clip it
occasionally, leaving an 8-inch stubble, so as to produce a more succulent
growth.</p>

<p>An acre of sweet-clover pasture ordinarily will support 20 to 30
shotes in addition to furnishing a tight cutting of hay (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).
For the best growth of the hogs, they should be fed each day 2
pounds of grain per hundredweight of the stock. Hogs are very
fond of sweet clover roots and should be ringed before being turned
on the pasture. The tendency to root may generally be overcome
by adding some protein to the grain ration. Meat meal serves
this purpose very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>« 7 »</span></p>

<p>The Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station conducted an interesting
pasturing experiment with spring pigs in 1910, In this experiment,
pigs weighing approximately 38 pounds each were pastured
for a period of 141 days on two plats of red clover, a plat of Dwarf
Essex rape, and a plat of yellow biennial sweet clover. The pigs
pasturing on each plat received a ration of ear corn. The ration
given to the pigs on one plat of red clover and on that of rape was
supplemented with meat meal to the extent of one-tenth of the ear corn
ration. The feed given to the pigs pasturing on sweet clover
was supplemented with meat meal at the same rate during only the
last 57 days of the test. The red clover was seeded in 1908 and reseeded
in 1909, so that the plat contained a very good stand of plants
at least one year old. The sweet clover was seeded in the spring of
1910, while the rape was sown on April 4, 1910, in 24-inch rows.
The pigs were turned on the forage plats on June 22.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Hogs pasturing on sweet clover.</p></div>
</div>


<p>The results of this experiment, as presented in <a href="#Table_I">Table I</a>, show that
sweet clover carried more pigs to the acre and produced cheaper gains
and a greater net profit per acre than either red clover or rape. To
judge from the date of seeding of the plants tested, it was to be expected
that the pigs pasturing on the sweet clover would not gain as
rapidly at first as those pasturing on the other forage plants, as the
growth of the sweet clover at this time was undoubtedly much less
than that of the other crops. This assumption is borne out by the
results given for the first 84 days of the test. During this period
the pigs on the rape made a net gain of $11.55 per acre and those on
the red clover $6.86 per acre more than those on the sweet clover. In
these computations corn was valued at 50 cents per bushel and hogs
at $6 per hundredweight. During the latter part of the experiment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>« 8 »</span>
there was but a scant growth of red clover on the plats, while the
sweet clover produced an abundance of forage, and during this
period of the experiment the pigs pasturing on sweet clover made a
net gain of $10.14 per acre more than those pasturing on red clover
and $17.41 per acre more than those pasturing on rape. (<a href="#Table_I">Table I</a>.)
The difference in net profits probably would have been greater had
white sweet clover been used instead of yellow sweet clover, as it
makes a larger growth and contains approximately the same ratio
of food elements.</p>

<p>An experiment reported by the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment
Station shows that a mixture of rape and sweet clover makes an
exceptionally fine pasture for hogs. In this experiment the mixture
of rape and sweet clover produced more pasturage than alfalfa and
was preferred to alfalfa by the hogs. It was seeded at the rate of 6
pounds of Dwarf Essex rape and 10 pounds of sweet clover to the
acre.</p>

<p>Sheep relish sweet clover and make rapid gains when pastured on
it. Care must be taken to see that pastures are not overstocked with
sheep, as they are likely to eat the plants so close to the ground as to
kill them. This is especially true the first year, before the plants
have formed crown buds. Yellow biennial sweet clover probably
would not suffer from this cause as much as the white species, because
the plants make a more prostrate growth and are not likely
to be eaten so closely to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>« 9 »</span></p>

<p>Horses and mules do well on sweet-clover pastures. On account of
the high protein content sweet clover provides excellent pasturage for
young stock. No cases of slobbering have been noted with horses.</p>


<h3>TAINTING MILK AND BUTTER.</h3>

<p>Milk may be tainted occasionally when cows are pasturing on sweet
clover. However, the large majority of farmers who pasture sweet
clover on an extensive scale report very little or no trouble. The
flavor imparted to milk at times is not disliked by all people, as some
state that it is agreeable and does not harm the market value of dairy
products in the least. This trouble is experienced for the most part
in the early spring. The tainting of milk may be avoided by taking
the cows off the pasture two hours before milking and keeping them
off until after milking the following morning.</p>


<h3>BLOATING.</h3>

<p>Unlike the true clovers and alfalfa, sweet clover seldom causes
bloat; in fact, with the exception of the summer of 1915, only a few
authentic cases of bloat have thus far been recorded in sections where
large acreages are pastured with cattle and sheep. A number of
cases of bloat wore reported in Iowa during the abnormally wet
season of 1915. No satisfactory explanation for this comparative
freedom from bloating has been offered. It is held by some that the
coumarin in the plants prevents bloating, but this has not been
established experimentally.</p>


<h3>TREATMENT FOR BLOAT.</h3>

<p><i>Cattle.</i>&mdash;If the case of bloat is not extreme, it may be sufficient to
drive the animals at a walk for a quarter or half an hour. In urgent
cases the gas must be allowed to escape without delay, and this
is best accomplished by the use of the trocar. In selecting the place
for using the trocar, the highest point of the distended flank equally
distant from the last rib and the point of the hip must be chosen.
Here an incision about three-fourths of an inch long should be made
with a knife through the skin, and then the sharp point of the trocar,
being directed downward, inward, and slightly forward, is thrust
into the paunch. The sheath of the trocar should be left in the
paunch as long as any gas continues to issue from it. In the absence
of a trocar an incision may be made with a small-bladed knife and
a quill used to permit the gas to escape. Care must be taken to see
that the quill does not work down out of sight into the incision.</p>

<p>Another remedy consists in tying a large bit, the diameter of a
pitchfork handle, in the mouth, so that a piece of rubber tubing may
be passed through the mouth to the first stomach to allow the gas
to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>« 10 »</span></p>

<p>When the animal is not distressed and the swelling of the flank is
not great, or when the most distressing condition has been removed
by the use of the trocar, it is best to administer internal medicine.
Two ounces of aromatic spirits of ammonia should be given every
half hour in a quart of cold water, or half an ounce of chlorid of
lime may be dissolved in a pint of tepid water and the dose repeated
every half hour until the bloating has subsided.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> See "Diseases of Cattle," a special report of the Bureau of Animal Industry.</p></div>

<p>For acute bloating the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station
recommends 1 quart of a 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent solution of formalin, followed
by placing a wooden block in the animal's mouth and by gentle
exercise if the animal can be gotten up.</p>

<p><i>Sheep.</i>&mdash;Gas may be removed quickly from bloated sheep by using
a small trocar. The seat of the operation is on the most prominent
portion of the left flank.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SWEET-CLOVER_HAY">SWEET-CLOVER HAY.</h2>
</div>


<p>When sweet-clover hay is cut at the right time and cured properly
it is eaten readily by all classes of live stock. As the hay is rich in
protein, growing stock make gains on it comparable to the gains of
those fed on alfalfa. The quantity and quality of the milk produced
when the hay is fed to cows are approximately the same as when other
legumes are used. Hay which is cut the first year is fine stemmed
and leafy and resembles alfalfa in general appearance. Unless it
is cut at the proper time the second year, it will be stemmy and unpalatable.
Feeding experiments show that it contains practically
as much digestible protein as alfalfa and more than red clover, but
the hay is not as palatable as red clover or alfalfa when the plants
are permitted to become coarse and woody. When sweet clover is
seeded in the spring without a nurse crop in the northern and
western sections of the United States, a cutting of hay may be obtained
the same autumn. When it is seeded with a nurse crop in
these regions, the rainfall during the late summer and early fall will
largely determine whether the plants will make sufficient growth to
be cut for hay. On fertile, well-limed soils in the East, in the eastern
North-Central States, in Iowa, and in eastern Kansas a cutting of
hay is commonly obtained after grain harvest when the rainfall is
normal or above normal. In many sections of the country two, and
at times three, cuttings of hay may be obtained the second year
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>In the South two, and sometimes three, cuttings may be obtained
the first year if the seeding is done without a nurse crop. When the
seed is sown in the spring with oats, two cuttings may be secured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>« 11 »</span>
after oat harvest. Three cuttings may be obtained the second year,
although it is the common practice to cut the first crop for hay and
the second crop for seed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="YIELDS_OF_SWEET-CLOVER_HAY">YIELDS OF SWEET-CLOVER HAY.</h2>
</div>


<p>The total yields of sweet clover per acre for the season are usually
less than those of alfalfa except in the semiarid unirrigated portions
of the country. Sweet clover ordinarily yields more to the acre
than any of the true clovers.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig3" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig3.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Cutting sweet clover for hay in western Kansas.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the seed is sown in the spring in the North without a nurse
crop, yields of 1 to 3 tons of hay of good quality may be expected
the following autumn, The Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment
Station obtained 2,700 pounds of hay per acre in the fall from spring
seeding, while the United States Department of Agriculture obtained
3,000 pounds of hay per acre in August from May seeding
in Maryland. Yields of 1 to 2 tons, and occasionally 3 tons, have
been obtained in Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, the Dakotas, and
other States. In Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas yields of 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tons
are often obtained after grain harvest when weather conditions are
favorable.</p>

<p>The first crop the second season yields 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 3 tons of hay to the
acre in the northern and western sections of the United States. The
second crop of the second season will yield from three-fourths to 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
tons to the acre, although this crop usually is cut for seed.</p>

<p>When sweet clover is seeded in the South without a nurse crop
on fairly fertile soil that is not acid, three cuttings of hay, averaging
at least a ton to the cutting, may be secured the year of seeding.
When the seed is sown in the early spring on winter grain, two cuttings,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>« 12 »</span>
yielding at least 1 ton to the cutting, may be obtained. The
first crop the second season yields on an average 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 3 tons of hay
to the acre. In 1903 the Alabama Canebrake Station obtained 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
tons of hay after oat harvest and a total yield of 3 tons per acre from
the same field in 1904.</p>


<h3>TIME TO CUT SWEET CLOVER FOR HAY.</h3>

<p>The first season's growth of sweet clover does not usually get
coarse and woody and therefore may be cut when it shows its
maximum growth in the fall, In regions where more than one
crop may be obtained the first season, the first crop should be cut
when the plants have made about a 30-inch growth.</p>

<p>The proper time to cut the first crop the second season will vary
considerably in different localities, depending very much upon the
rainfall, the temperature, and the fertility of the soil. In no event
should the plants be permitted to show flower buds or to become
woody. In the semiarid sections of the country sweet clover does
not grow as rapidly as in more humid regions. Neither do the
plants grow as rapidly on poor soils as upon fertile soils. In the
drier sections the best results usually are obtained by cutting the
first crop when the plants have made a growth of 24 to 30 inches.
On fertile, well-limed soils in many sections of the country a very
rapid growth is made in the spring, and often the plants will not
show flower buds until they are about 5 feet high. On such soils
it is very essential that the first crop be cut when the plants have
made no more growth than 30 to 32 inches if hay is desired which is
not stemmy and if a second growth is to be expected.</p>


<h3>HEIGHT OF STUBBLE TO BE LEFT WHEN CUTTING FOR HAY.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to leave more than an ordinary stubble when
cutting the sweet-clover hay crop in the fall of the year of seeding.
A stubble 4 or 6 inches in height, however, will serve to hold drifting
snow and undoubtedly will be of some help in protecting the
plants from winter injury. While sweet clover without question is
more hardy than red clover, usually more or less winterkilling
occurs, and any protection which may be afforded during cold
weather will be of considerable benefit.</p>

<p>While the first crop in the second year comes from the crown buds,
the new branches which produce the second crop of the second year
come from the buds formed in the axils of the leaves on the lower
portions of the stalks which constitute the first crop, as shown in
<a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>. These branches usually commence growth when the plants
are about 24 inches high. In fields where the stand is heavy and
where the lower portions of the plants are densely shaded, these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>« 13 »</span>
shoots are soon killed from lack of necessary light. (Figs. <a href="#fig4">4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a>.)
The branches which are first to appear and which are first to be
killed are those closest to the ground. It is therefore very important
when cutting this crop to cut the plants high enough from the
ground to leave on the stubble a sufficient number of buds and young
branches to produce a second crop.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp68" id="fig4" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig4.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="captionj"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Sweet-clover plants, showing the direct relation that exists between the thickness
of stand, the time of cutting, and the height at which the stubble must be cut
if a second crop is to be expected. The plant at the left was cut 10 day later than
the plant at the right. Note the height at which it was necessary to cut this plant
so that a second crop would develop and also the scars on the stubble where young
shoots had started earlier and were killed from lack of sunlight. When the stand is
thin the young shoots will survive, as they did on the plant at the right, even though
the field is cut at a later date.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Examination of hundreds of acres of sweet clover in different sections
of the United States during the summers of 1915 and 1916
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>« 14 »</span>
showed that the stand on at least 50 per cent of the fields was partly
or entirely killed by cutting the first crop the second season too close
to the ground. A direct relation exists between the thickness of the
stand, the height of the plants, and the height at which the stubble
should be cut if a second crop is to be harvested. It is very essential
to examine the fields carefully before mowing, so as to determine
the height at which the plants should be cut in order to leave at least
one healthy bud or young branch on each stub. In fact, the stand
should be cut several inches above the young shoots or buds, the
stubble may die back from 1 to 3 inches if the plants are cut during
damp or rainy weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="fig5" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig5.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="captionj"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Stubble of sweet clover collected in fields where 90 per cent of the plants had
been killed by cutting too closely to the ground. The heavy stands in these fields were
not cut until the plants had made a growth of 36 to 40 inches. Note the scars on the
stubble where young shoots started, but died from lack of light.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>« 15 »</span></p>

<p>When fields of sweet clover contain only a medium-heavy stand
and when the plants have made no more than a 30-inch growth, a 5
to 6 inch stubble usually will be sufficient to insure a second crop,
but where fields contain heavy stands&mdash;15 to 25 plants to the square
foot&mdash;it may be necessary to leave an 8-inch stubble. In many
fields examined in northern Illinois in June, 1916, heavy stands had
been permitted to make a growth of 36 to 40 inches before cutting.
In a number of these fields a very large percentage of the plants
were killed when an 8 to 12 inch stubble was left. (See <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>.)
A careful examination of such fields showed that the young branches
had started on the lower portions of the stalks and had died from
lack of light before cutting. In semiarid regions, where the plants
do not make as rapid growth as in humid sections, they may, as a
rule, be clipped somewhat closer to the ground without injury.</p>

<p>On account of the difference in the growth that sweet clover makes
on different types of soil and on account of the difference in the
thickness of the stand obtained in different fields, it is impossible to
give any definite rule as to the proper height to cut the first crop.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig6" >

mowers.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>MOWER CHANGES FOR CUTTING SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>It is good practice to replace the shoe soles of the mower with
higher adjustable soles, so that a stubble up to 12 inches in height
may be left when cutting sweet clover, Shoe soles such as are
shown in figures 6 and 7 may be made on any farm provided
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>« 16 »</span>
with a blacksmith's forge, or they can be made at any blacksmith
shop at a cost which should not exceed $2.50. Preferably
they should be of strap iron, about one-fourth of an inch thick and
2 inches wide; however, old pieces of iron or steel which may be
found on the farm will serve the purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig7" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig7.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="captionj"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Shoe sole to be Used on the outer shoe of the mower, so that a high stubble
may be left when cutting sweet clover; <i>A</i>, End view of the back part of the sole;
<i>B</i>, side view of the sole, showing general shape; <i>C</i>, forward end of the sole to be used
on certain Deering machines; <i>D</i>, end view of the front part of sole shown in <i>B</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then these soles are to be placed on machines that have shoes of
the type used on the Deering mower, the forward 8 inches of the
sole for the inner shoe should be tapered gradually to a blunt point
and bent in such a manner that it will hook into the slot in the shoe.
(<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>, <i>C</i>.) When the soles are to be placed on mowers having
shoes of the type used on McCormick machines, the forward 8 inches
of the sole for the inner shoe should be tapered gradually to about 1
inch in width, bent forward so that it will fit against that portion
of the shoe where it is to be bolted, and have a hole of the proper
size bored for the bolt three-fourths of an inch from the end. (Fig.6, <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>.)
The bottom of the sole should be rounded, so as to
run smoothly on the ground when the cutter bar is raised to cut at
different heights. The back portion of the sole should be upright
and should have holes bored in it, so that it may be set for the
cutter bar to rest at different heights from the ground. Preferably
the lower hole of the upright should be located so that when the
bolt in the shoe is run through it the cutter bar will be 6 inches from
the ground. It should be long enough to permit four or five holes,
1 inch apart, to be bored above the lower one. (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>, <i>A</i>.)</p>

<p>With some makes of machines it is not advisable to raise the cutter
bar higher than 10 inches from the ground, but when this is true
the cutter bar may be tipped upward, so that a 12-inch stubble is left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>« 17 »</span></p>

<p>The forward end of the shoe sole to be used on the outer shoe
should be tapered gradually to 1 inch from the end. The forward
inch should be one-fourth of an inch in width and bent slightly upward
and inward, so that a hook will be formed to fit into the slot
in the front end of the shoe. (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, <i>B</i>.) The rest of the sole should
curved, so that it will run smoothly on the ground when the cutter
bar is set to cut at different heights. The upright which is bolted
to the sole should preferably be made of three-eighths by 1 inch
material and should have six holes, 1 inch apart, bored in it, so that
the outer end of the cutter bar may be raised to the same height as
the inner end. On practically all standard makes of mowers the
outer shoe sole hooks into the shoe instead of bolting to it, as is the
case with the inner sole on some machines. A wheel is used in place
of a shoe sole on the outer end of the cutter bar on some machines.
When this is the case, the upright to which this wheel is attached
should be lengthened. On other machines the forward end of the
sole hooks into a slot in the shoe in the same manner as the inner
sole. In this event the front end of the sole should be bent slightly
upward and outward. (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, <i>C</i>.)</p>

<p>Before shoe soles are made for any mower a careful examination
should be made of the shoes to determine the exact size required
and the manner in which they should be attached to the forward
ends of the shoes.</p>


<h3>CURING AND HANDLING SWEET-CLOVER HAY.</h3>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties in curing sweet clover is the fact
that the plants usually are ready to be cut for hay at a time of the
year when weather conditions are likely to be unfavorable for
haymaking. Little trouble is experienced in curing this crop in the
drier sections of the country where the methods used for alfalfa are
employed. The curing of sweet clover is more difficult than the
curing of either red clover or alfalfa, as the leaves are very apt to
shatter before the stems are cured. Every possible means should be
employed to save the leaves, as these constitute the best part of the
hay. (See <a href="#Table_II">Table II</a>.)</p>

<p>The hay collected for the above analyses represented the first cutting
the second season. The plants had made a 30 to 36 inch growth
at the time of cutting. It will be seen that the protein content of
the leaves is almost three times as great as that of the stems.</p>

<p>In the drier sections of the country or when the first crop of the
year of seeding is cut for hay in the North-Central States the mower
may be started in the morning as soon as the dew is off. The hay
should remain in the swath until the following day, or until it is
well wilted, when it should be raked into small windrows. After
remaining in the windrows for a day it may be placed in small cocks
to cure. Cocks made from hay which has dried to this stage will
not shed water well and therefore should be covered if it is likely
to rain. It is important that the cocks be made small enough to be
thrown on the rack entire, as many leaves will be lost if it is necessary
to tear them apart.</p>

</div>

<p>When sweet clover is permitted to dry in the swath, a large percentage
of the leaves will be lost in windrowing and loading unless
handled with the utmost care. Hay in this condition should never
be raked while perfectly dry and brittle, but should be raked into
the windrow in the early morning or in the evening, when it is
slightly damp from dew. It may then be hauled to the barn or stack
after remaining in the windrow for a day.</p>

<p>One of the most successful methods for handling sweet-clover hay,
especially in regions where rains are likely to occur at haying time,
is to permit the plants to remain in the swath until they are well
wilted or just before the leaves begin to cure. The hay should then
be raked into windrows and cocked at once (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). The cocks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>« 19 »</span>
should be made as high and as narrow as possible, as this will permit
better ventilation. In curing, the cocks will shrink from one-third
to one-half of their original size. It may take from 10 days to 2
weeks to cure sweet clover by this method, but when well cured all
the leaves will be intact and the hay will have an excellent color and
aroma. When sweet clover is cocked at this time the leaves will
cure flat and in such a manner that the cocks will readily shed
water during heavy rains (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>When sweet-clover hay is to be stacked it is highly desirable that
some sort of foundation be made for the stack, so as to prevent the
loss of the hay which otherwise would be on the ground. Several
feet of straw or grass are often used for this purpose, but still better
is a foundation of rails, posts, or boards placed in such a manner
that air may circulate under the stack.</p>

<p>A cover should be provided for the stacks, either in the form of a
roof, a canvas, or long green grass. If none of these means is practicable
a topping of perfectly green sweet clover will cure with the
leaves flat and will turn water nicely.</p>

<p>It is well known that hay made from either red clover or alfalfa
will often undergo spontaneous combustion if put into the barn
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>« 20 »</span>
with too much external moisture upon it. No instances of spontaneous
combustion in sweet-clover hay have been noted, but this may
be due to the fact that comparatively little sweet-clover hay is stored
in barns. The same precautions, therefore, should be taken with
sweet-clover hay as with red clover or alfalfa.</p>

<h2><a id="SWEET_CLOVER_AS_A_SILAGE_CROP"></a>SWEET CLOVER AS A SILAGE CROP.</h2>
</div>


<p>In some sections of the country sweet clover is gaining in favor as
a silage crop, either alone or in mixtures with other plants. The
silage made from this plant will keep better than that made from
most legumes, as it does not become slimy, as is so often the case with
red clover or alfalfa silage. It produces a palatable feed, which
should contain more protein than well-matured corn silage.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig10" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig10.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Filling the silo with sweet clover.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When sweet clover makes sufficient growth after grain harvest,
or when seeded alone, it is not necessary to cut it for silage until
fall. At this time it may be run into the silo alone or in mixture
with corn. Excellent results have been obtained by placing alternate
loads of corn and sweet clover in the silo. (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>.)</p>

<p>When the first crop the second season is not needed for pasturage,
ensiling may prove to be the most economical and profitable way of
handling it, as it is necessary to cut this crop for hay at a time of
the year when the weather conditions in humid regions are very
likely to be unfavorable for haymaking. The large percentage of
leaves which usually are lost from shattering when harvesting the
hay will be saved when the crop is run into the silo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>« 21 »</span></p>

<p>The first crop the second season will produce approximately two-thirds
as much silage to the acre as corn when it is cut at the time it
should be cut for hay. The second crop may then be harvested for
seed. When sweet clover is handled in this manner, approximately
two-thirds of the total corn acreage which would be cut for silage
may be permitted to mature, as the first crop of sweet clover will replace
the corn silage, while the seed crop ordinarily will bring as
much per acre as the corn. In addition to this, the roots and stubble
will add large quantities of vegetable matter to the soil.</p>

<p>Some farmers do not cut sweet clover for silage until it is in full
bloom. When this is done, 10 to 12 tons of silage will be obtained
per acre, but the plants will be killed by the mowing.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig11" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig11.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 11.&mdash;Cutting sweet clover with a grain binder for silage.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the green plants are ensiled, the crop preferably should be
cut with a grain binder. (See illustration on title-page and <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>.)
This will solve the difficulty of cutting a high stubble and will at the
same time bind the plants so that they may be run through the silage
cutter without difficulty. Green plants, and especially the first crop
of the second season, contain too much moisture to be run into the
silo immediately after cutting. In some cases quantities of juice
have been pressed out of the bottom of the silo, and as a result the
silage settled considerably. <a id="juice">Analyses of the juice</a> from one silo
showed that it contained 0.23 per cent protein and 2 per cent carbohydrates.
This loss of juice may be overcome by permitting the
bundles to remain in the field just as they come from the binder until
the plants are wilted thoroughly. Straw or corn stover may be
placed in the bottom of the silo to absorb some of the juice. If the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>« 22 »</span>
plants contain too much moisture it may be a good plan to mix some
corn stover with the sweet clover as it is run into the silo.</p>

<p>Several silos in Illinois have been filled with sweet-clover straw.
When this is done it is necessary to add sufficient water to moisten
the dry stems. These stems become soft in a short time and ensile
in good condition. When the seed crop is thrashed with either a
grain separator or a clover huller the stems are broken and crushed
sufficiently to render it unnecessary to run them through a silage cutter.
Care must be taken when ensiling the straw to add sufficient
water, if molding is to be avoided. It will probably be necessary to
add water at the blower and also at the top of the silo. It is essential
to tramp the straw thoroughly, so as to exclude as much air as
possible. After the silo is filled it should be covered with a layer
of green plants and thoroughly soaked with water.</p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#Table_III">Table III</a> the analyses of the first and second years'
growth of sweet clover compare favorably in food elements with
corn silage. It is to be expected that the silage made from the sweet
clover straw would contain less protein and carbohydrates than that
made from the entire plants, as most of the leaves shatter from sweet
clover before the seed crop is cut. Considerable protein and carbohydrates
were lost from the silage made from the first crop the second
season, as the plants were run into the silo as soon as they were
cut. Much juice was pressed from the bottom of this silo. An
analysis of this juice is given on <a href="#juice">page 21</a>.</p>

<p>As a soiling crop sweet clover has been used to only a very limited
extent. The amperage yields of green matter vary from 6 to 15 tons
per acre, The season for soiling may commence when the plants
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>« 23 »</span>
are 12 to 15 inches high and continue until flower buds appear. An
area of such a size that the plants may be cut every four or five
weeks should be selected. The plants should not be cut closer to the
ground than 4 inches during the first part of the season and 9 to 12
inches during the latter part of the season. On account of the high
protein content and the large amount of forage produced on a relatively
small area, sweet clover may profitably be fed in this manner
when more desirable soiling crops are not to be had.</p>

<h3>PALATABILITY OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>The woody growth of sweet clover as it reaches maturity and the
bitter taste due to coumarin have been the principal causes for live
stock refusing to eat it at first. On this account many farmers have
assumed it to be worthless as a feed. It is a fact that stock seldom
eat the hard, woody stems of mature plants, but it is true also that
stock eat sparingly of the coarse, fibrous growth of such legumes as
red or mammoth clover when they have been permitted to mature
and have lost much of their palatability. All kinds of stock will
eat green sweet clover before it becomes woody, or hay which has
been cut at the proper time and well cured, after they have become
accustomed to it. Many cases are on record in which cattle have
refused alfalfa or red clover when sweet clover was accessible. Milch
cows have been known to refuse a ration of alfalfa hay when given
to them for the first time. Western range cattle which have never
been fed corn very often refuse to eat corn fodder, or even corn, for
a short time, and instances have come under observation in which
they ate the dried husks and left the corn uneaten. When these
cattle were turned on green grass the following spring they browsed
on the dead grass of the preceding season's growth, which, presumably
more closely resembled the grass to which they were accustomed.
Such preliminary observations should never be taken as
final, even when they represent the results of careful investigators.
When cowpeas were first introduced into certain sections of this
country much trouble was experienced in getting stock to eat the
vines, either when cured into hay or made into ensilage. This difficulty,
however, was soon overcome.</p>

<p>It is very true that stock which have never been pastured on sweet
clover or fed on the hay must become accustomed to it before
they will eat it, but the fact that sweet clover is now being fed to
stock in nearly every State indicates that the distaste for it can be
overcome easily and successfully. As sweet clover usually starts
growth earlier in the spring than other forage plants and as the
early growth presumably contains less coumarin than older plants,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>« 24 »</span>
stock seldom refuse to eat it at this time. Properly cured hay is
seldom refused by stock, especially if it is sprinkled with salt water
when the animals are salt hungry.</p>


<h3>COMPOSITION OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Sweet clover, like most legumes, contains a relatively high percentage
of protein, thus making it a source of that valuable constituent
of feeds needed for growing stock and for the production of milk.
<a href="#Table_IV">Table IV</a> shows the relative composition and digestibility of sweet
clover as compared to some other feeds.</p>

the proper stage for curing into hay. <a href="#Table_IV">Table IV</a> also shows that the
digestible nutrients of sweet clover when fed to sheep compare favorably
with alfalfa. It was stated that the sweet-clover hay used
for this experiment was stemmy and that it had not been cut until
it had become woody. The pea hay had passed the best stage for
cutting when it was harvested, while the alfalfa hay was in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>In a feeding experiment with sheep conducted by two students at
the Iowa State College it was found that the protein digested in
sweet-clover feed alone was 69 per cent and that the addition of corn
to the hay ration increased the digestibility of sweet clover to 82
per cent. Alfalfa and red clover showed similar increases of the
digestibility of the protein content when corn was added to the ration.
The percentage of digestibility figured for the protein in the corn
was the average of a number of digestion experiments. The probability
is that the digestibility of the corn was also increased by the
presence of the hay in the ration, so that not all the increase in the
digestibility should be credited to the hay constituents of the different
rations.</p>


<h3>FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Few agricultural experiment stations have carried on definite feeding
experiments to determine the value of sweet clover compared
with other feeds.</p>

<p>The South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station reported an
experiment in which lambs were fed on sweet-clover hay in comparison
with alfalfa, pea-vine, and prairie hay. In this experiment the
lambs made a better gain at a less cost when fed sweet-clover hay
than when fed pea-vine hay, but not as large a gain as when fed
alfalfa hay. The results of this experiment are shown in <a href="#Table_V">Table V</a>.</p>

lambs each were fed different mixtures of feeds for 14 weeks. Those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>« 26 »</span>
receiving sweet-clover hay, corn, and a small amount of oil meal made
an average gain of 30.7 pounds per head, as compared with 20.3 pounds

<p>The sweet-clover hay used in this experiment was described as
stemmy and more than a year old; yet it was eaten up clean by the
lambs.</p>

<p>The South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station conducted an
experiment in which steers were fed corn silage and various kinds
of hay, including sweet clover. The steers which were fed corn silage
and sweet-clover hay made an average daily gain of 2.45 pounds, at
a cost of $4.34 per hundred pounds of gain, whereas the steers which
were fed corn silage and red-clover hay made an average daily gain
of 2.29 pounds, at a cost of $4.55 per hundred. The steers that were
fed corn silage and alfalfa hay made an average daily gain of 2.49
pounds, at a cost of $4.30 per hundred. In computing the cost of
the gains, corn silage was valued at $3 per ton, alfalfa, red-clover,
and sweet-clover hay at $10 per ton, and prairie hay at $6 per ton.
The results of this experiment, as given in <a href="#Table_VII">Table VII</a>, show that
sweet-clover hay is practically equal to red-clover and alfalfa and
greatly superior to prairie hay for roughage for steers.</p>

<p>The results of these various experiments are being duplicated
every year by many feeders. Each year in the Middle West and
Northwest many cattle that bring high prices are being fed with
no other roughage than sweet-clover hay. Steers which have been
pastured entirely on sweet clover have brought in the Chicago market
$1 per hundredweight more than ordinary grass-pastured stock
marketed from the same locality and at the same time.</p>

<p>Excellent results were obtained in Lee County, Ill., from feeding
steers sweet-clover silage made from plants which had matured
a seed crop. For this experiment 91 head of steers 2 and 3
years old, averaging 1,008 pounds per head, were purchased at the
Kansas City stock yards on November 16, 1915, at a cost of $6.30
per hundred. These steers were shipped to a farm at Steward
and immediately turned on 120 acres of cornstalks. They were
fed nothing in addition to the cornstalks until January 14, 1916,
when they were put into the feed lot. While they were not weighed
when turned into the feed lot, the owner of the steers stated that in
his estimation they had gained but little, if any. During the 60
days these steers were in the feed lot they were fed 25 bushels of
snapped corn twice a day and as much sweet-clover silage as they
would eat. These animals had access to sweet-clover straw during
the first part of the feeding period, but after this was consumed they
had only oat straw as roughage. At the end of the feeding period
they were sold on the Chicago market at the average price of $8.25
per hundred, netting approximately $30 per head. The average
weight of these steers in the Chicago yards was 1,177 pounds, 169
pounds more than when purchased in Kansas City.</p>

<p>A most remarkable feature of this experiment is the fact that the
steers were fed almost entirely material which would have been considered
of little value by the average farmer. The corn which was
fed tested 44 per cent moisture at the Rochelle, Ill., elevator, and 20
cents per bushel was the best price offered for it.</p>

<p>Presumably on account of wet weather during the fall of 1915, the
sweet-clover seed crop was a failure in that section; in fact, the crop
had been cut for seed and part had been thrashed before it was
decided that the seed yield was not sufficient to pay for the thrashing.
The remainder of the crop was then run into the silo and fed to the
steers. The leaves fall and the stems of this plant become hard and
woody as the seed matures. The crop therefore would have been
worthless for feed had it not been placed in the silo. As a rule,
stock readily eat sweet-clover straw when the stems are broken and
crushed by the hulling machines. The sweet-clover straw which
was used as roughage during the first part of the feeding period
was from that part of the seed crop which had been thrashed.</p>

<p>An interesting feeding experiment was conducted on a farm at
Rochelle, Ill. On September 7, 1913, 29 head of 2-year-old steers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>« 28 »</span>
averaging 836 pounds, were turned on 40 acres of sweet clover which
had been seeded that spring with barley. These animals were pastured
on the sweet clover until November 1 without additional feed.
During this time they made exceptionally large gains. From November
1 to December 11, 28 head of these steers had access to an 80-acre
field of cornstalks. On December 11 they were put into the feed
lot. During the time these steers were on the cornstalks they barely
held their gain, but during the first 30 days they were in the feed lot
they made an average daily gain of almost 3 pounds. In this period
they received 215 bushels of corn-and-cob meal and 16<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> tons of silage
made from the first-year growth of sweet clover. During the next
30 days they received 388 bushels of corn-and-cob meal and much
less sweet-clover, silage. During this time they made an average
daily gain of 2 pounds. When the corn-and-cob meal ration was
increased the steers ate less silage. These cattle dressed 55<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> per cent
at a Chicago packing house.</p>

<p>Unlike many legumes, sweet clover will make a good growth on
soils too depleted in humus for profitable crop production. In
addition to its ability to grow and to produce a considerable quantity
of forage on such soils, it will add much humus to them. The
extensive root systems do much toward breaking up the subsoil,
thereby providing better aeration and drainage. The effect of the
large, deep roots in opening up the subsoil and providing better
drainage is often very noticeable in the spring, as the land upon
which sweet clover has grown for several years will be in a condition
to plow earlier than the adjacent fields where it has not been grown.
The roots are often one-eighth of an inch in diameter at a depth
of 3 feet, and they decay in five to eight weeks after the plants die.
(Figs. <a href="#fig12">12</a> and <a href="#fig13">13</a>.) The holes made by the roots are left partly
filled with a fibrous substance which permits rapid drainage.
Sandy soils are benefited materially by the addition of humus and
nitrogen, while hardpan often is broken up so completely that
alfalfa or other crops will readily grow on the land. The roots
add much organic matter to the layers of soil below the usual depth
of plowing, while those in the surface soil, together with the stubble
and stems, when the crop is plowed under, add more humus than
possibly any other legume which may be grown in short rotations.
Not only does this crop add organic matter to the soil, but in common
with other legumes it has the power of fixing atmospheric
nitrogen by means of the nitrogen-gathering bacteria in the nodules
on the roots.</p>

<p>The ability of sweet clover to reclaim abandoned, run-down land
has been demonstrated in northern Kentucky and in Alabama. In
these regions many farms were so depleted in nitrogen and humus
by continuous cropping with nonleguminous crops that profitable
yields could be obtained no longer, Through the use of this crop
many of these farms have been brought back to a fair state of fertility.
Tests at the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station show
that the increased yield of corn following sweet clover which had
occupied the land for two years was 6<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> bushels per acre. The cotton
grown on the land the second year showed an increase of 56
pounds per acre. The combined value of the increased yields of
corn and cotton for the two years was estimated at $9.75. The
total yield of hay for the two preceding years was 6.8 tons per acre.
In another experiment at this station cotton was planted on land
that had grown sweet clover the two previous years and on land
that had received an application of 18 tons of stable manure per
acre. The sweet-clover plat produced 280 pounds of seed cotton
the first year and 120 pounds of seed cotton the second year more
than the plat which received the heavy application of manure.</p>

<p>Land on which sweet clover had been grown for four years at the
Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station yielded 26.9 bushels of wheat
per acre as compared with 18.6 bushels on the check plat. Sweet clover
was seeded at the Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station in
the spring of 1912. One cutting of hay was removed that year and
the following spring the field was plowed and planted to corn. The
corn yielded 58.8 bushels per acre as compared with 41.1 bushels
per acre for an adjoining plat where rye was turned under. A number
of tests have been conducted in southeastern Kansas which show
clearly the value of sweet clover as a soil-improving crop for that
section. The yield of wheat has been increased as much as 7 bushels
per acre and that of corn as much as 22 bushels per acre by plowing
under the second-year growth of clover.</p>

<p>Annual yellow sweet clover is rapidly gaining in favor as a green-manure
crop for orchards in the Southwest. In Arizona two plats
seeded in October and plowed under in April yielded, respectively,
16 and 17 tons of green matter to the acre. At the Arizona Agricultural
Experiment Station annual yellow sweet clover, lupines, and
alfalfa were tested as green-manure crops for orchards. In this experiment
the sweet clover clearly showed its superiority to lupines or
alfalfa for this purpose, as it yielded from 21 to 26 tons of green
matter per acre, whereas the highest yield for the lupines was 10
tons and for the alfalfa 15 tons per acre.</p>

<p>The use of annual sweet clover as a green-manure crop in southern
California has increased very rapidly in recent years, and this increased
use apparently has been justified by the results obtained
with it. One of the most interesting green-manure tests thus far
noted was conducted at the California Citrus Experiment Station.
In this experiment nine legume plats and eight nonlegume plats
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>« 31 »</span>
alternated with each other. The 4-year average weight of green
matter produced on the sweet-clover plat was 14<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> tons per acre,
whereas the 5-year average weight of green matter produced by
common vetch and Canada field peas was 12 tons and 9 tons, respectively,
per acre. On one series of these plats corn was planted in
rotation with the clover. The average yield of shelled corn for four
years was 46 bushels to the acre on the sweet-clover plat, as compared
with 35 bushels to the acre on the common-vetch plat and 40 bushels
per acre on the field-pea plat. One barley plat receiving each year an
application of 1,080 pounds of nitrate of soda gave an average yield
of 41 bushels per acre. The 2-year average yield of potatoes following
sweet clover was 252 bushels per acre, as compared with 171 bushels
following common vetch and 234 bushels following field peas.
Sweet clover has proved to be an excellent plant to grow in rotation
with sugar beets, as the 2-year average for the beets following it
was 19.8 tons per acre, as compared with 15.3 tons following common
vetch, and 17.6 tons following field peas.</p>

<p>Annual yellow sweet clover makes a profitable growth only in the
South and Southwest and therefore should not be planted in any
other section of the country.</p>

<p>In those sections of the United States where the soils are low in
humus it is to be strongly recommended that sweet clover be grown
for green manure. This method is being practiced in some sections
of the country with excellent results.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that sweet clover will not make a satisfactory
growth on acid soils and that it is very essential to provide
inoculation if the soil is not inoculated already.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="SWEET_CLOVER_IN_ROTATIONS">SWEET CLOVER IN ROTATIONS.</h2>

<p>As sweet clover is a biennial plant, it lends itself readily to short
rotations. It may be seeded in the spring on winter grain or with
spring grain, the same as red clover. It will produce at least as much
pasturage the following fall as red clover, and in some parts of the
country a cutting of hay may be obtained after the grain harvest. The
following year the plants will produce two cuttings of hay or one cutting
of hay and a seed crop. In some sections of the United States
this plant is replacing red clover in rotations, as it will succeed on
poorer soils than red clover and will add much more humus to the
soil. It will withstand drought better than either red clover or
alfalfa, and on this account its use in rotations may be extended into
drier sections. As a rule the beneficial effect of sweet clover on the
subsequent crops is more marked than that of other legumes. This
is especially true with corn, and whenever possible corn should follow
sweet clover in rotations. Root crops also are benefited by its use
in rotations, as the large deep roots of sweet clover open up the soil.</p>

<p>A number of the leading honey plants fail to secrete nectar in part
of the territory in which they are found, but white sweet clover ranks
as a valuable source of nectar wherever found in sufficient quantity
in the United States. The period of nectar secretion usually follows
that of white and alsike clovers in the Northern States, and
consequently comes at a time when the colonies are strong enough
to get the full benefit of the secretion. The honey from white sweet
clover is light in color, with a slight green tint, the flavor being mild
and suggestive of vanilla. The characteristic flavor and color of the
honey seem to be less marked during a rapid secretion of nectar, In
the irrigated portions of the West honey from white sweet clover is
often mixed with that from alfalfa.</p>

<p>Beekeepers have long recognized the value of sweet clover as a
source of nectar, and for years tons of seed have been sold annually
by dealers in beekeepers' supplies. It has never been found profitable
to cultivate any plant solely for nectar, and those beekeepers
who were primarily interested in the plant for bee forage have scattered
the seed chiefly in waste places and along railroad embankments
and roadsides. A number of beekeepers who were also engaged
in general farming have for years utilized the plant for forage, and
they were among the earliest to grow the plant for seed, so as to be
able to supply their fellow beekeepers. Sweet clover to-day is almost
the only plant which beekeepers seek to increase in waste lands in
their localities.</p>

<p>The yield of nectar from sweet clover is heavy, and a number of
beekeepers now market this honey in carload lots. Sweet clover is
utilized for honey especially in Kentucky, in Iowa, and in Colorado
and adjacent States. In Alabama and Mississippi a number of beekeepers
are harvesting large crops chiefly from this source. The color
and flavor make this plant suitable for either comb or extracted honey.</p>

<p>Yellow sweet clover is perhaps as valuable for nectar as white
sweet clover, but beekeepers have paid less attention to it. This is
probably due to the fact that the blooming period of the yellow
species often coincides with that of white and alsike clover, making
it less valuable to the beekeeper. In sections where the quantity of
white and alsike clover is limited and it is desired to plant sweet
clover for bee pasturage, a mixture of the white and yellow species
is recommended, as the yellow species will bloom from 10 to 14 days
earlier than the white.</p>

<p>Wherever any of the species of sweet clover are cultivated, either
for forage or for seed, beekeeping is to be recommended as a valuable
source of additional income, and such locations are especially suitable
for extensive commercial beekeeping.</p>
